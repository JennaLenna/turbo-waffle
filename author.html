			<h1 class="page-heading">I Write Books!</h1>
			<p class="lede">It's always funny to me, because most people see me as an artist first an an author second, but I typically see myself as the opposite! I've been writing "since I could write my name" (quote from my mom). I still remember the day I opened a blank notebook at 5 years old and began writing out shaky letters with a rainbow crayon. Nowadays, my entire approach to writing looks a lot different: I rotate between typing and writing on paper, and I do extensive character planning and worldbuilding. There's something magical about being able to do essentially anything with some words, and being able to bring the stories that already live in my head to life is too amazing of an opportunity to pass up.</p>

				data-title="Shocked"
				data-summary="In a world where a minuscule percentage of people develop abilites that cause insanity, a girl finds herself among that percentage, and, after being sent to a prison for teens like her, learns she's part of an experiment by a foundation bent on discovering the origins of her unusual DNA."
				data-genre="Science Fiction/Dystopian"
				data-age="YA"
				data-started="The idea came to me in 2023, as far as I know. Might've been 2022. I began a planning notebook for it on December 18, 2023, and I started work on the first book the following January."
				data-inspiration="I had the idea to write this after finishing the final Maze Runner movie with my brother, and thinking, 'okay, what about the insanity... but insteaed of everyone gets it, only a few people do?' From which my mind was happy to come up with plenty more ideas. It took everything not to immediately start work on it, but at the time, I was busy with a lot of other writing projects, so I didn't want to start something new right away."
				data-status="I'm currently deep into the first draft of Book 1, which is proudly entirely on paper. I typed up a few chapters of it, just to see where it was going, but I quickly realized I should probably have the first book completed before I type anything else up. So far, I haven't came across any huge roadblocks in the writing process, and I'm hoping things stay that way."
				data-recs="You want something a little gritter with potential for some serious dark themes."

			<article class="book-card" tabindex="0"
				data-title="The Midnight War"
				data-summary="When the threat of a third world war begins to loom over her country, a teenage girl attends a camp in search of answers pertaining to her past, and in the process, is faced with a difficult decision to stay out of things once and for all, or join the forces against the driving conflict for the future world war."
				data-genre="Science Fiction"
				data-age="YA"
				data-started="January 2023 (Feels like an eternity ago at this point 😭)"
				data-inspiration="There's a whole story about this one, and it's juicy. I actually started this book after starting a roleplay with some friends just a few days prior, and something about the characters we created was so compelling to me that I absolutely HAD to write a story about it. The funny thing is, though, I based the rest of the story off a vibe I'd gotten reading a fanfiction the year before 🤣"
				data-status="I'm on draft 6 or 7 (literally), and still struggling to find the heart of the story. I tried putting it on hold at some point, but it was too painful XD"
				data-recs="If you like the whole violence, relationship drama, and high stakes kind of story. Oh, and there's war!"

				data-title="The Zub Story"
				data-summary="A group of coders created a testing ground for VR software years ago, and it has since spun out of control, leading a 13-year-old girl who has been forced into this testing ground, unaware of its purpose, to team up with several of her peers and the last coder alive to save everyone from death by the game's monsters."
				data-genre="Not sure what to put for this. It's in journal format and has some sci-fi elements."
				data-age="Middle Grade"
				data-started="I recall this began in mid 2020, although I don't remember actually writing in the middle of COVID, so I may have actually started it even earlier."
				data-inspiration="I wanted to write this for my brother, actually. At the time, he wasn't a huge reader, and after seeing him decimate a really good series the two of us bonded over, I had a thought of, 'Okay, I'll just write him something random in the same style so he'll have something to read.' It took a while for him to notice it, but I think it's one of the only books I'm working on that he doesn't totally hate. 🤣 That being said, I've given the story a lot more attention and in 2023, the year of inspiration, I received a lot more inspiration and gave the story a major overhaul."
				data-status="I've been hard at work... on book 2 of this series. Book 1 is technically 'finished' in that I wrote the first draft, but it was years ago and it needs a complete rewrite to accomodate the changes I made to the story. Book 2 is where I'm really focusing my energy right now, and I hope to return to book 1 once I have a clearer idea of what to put in it."
				data-recs="You like adventure and ridiculous humor paired with drama and action."

				data-title="Ghost Story"
				data-summary="A ghost who can’t remember her own death falls for a living boy searching for the friend he lost—unaware that she is the one he’s been searching for—as a bitter ghost from a decade earlier haunts him, desperate to drag another living soul into death."
				data-genre="Contemporary fantasy/paranormal romance"
				data-age="YA (mature themes)"
				data-started="Summer 2024"
				data-inspiration="I got the idea for this story after me and my brother saw a chilling documentary about a ghost story, and I obviously said, 'I am so writing a book about this.' My brother wasn't totally convinced, but I've since fleshed out the theme of the story and given it a clear plot."
				data-status="I wrote a scene or two to this story before realizing I had no idea where it was headed, so the writing stage has taken a backseat for more planning and ideas. That being said, I'm constantly writing down more ideas and if I ever get my thoughts in order, I hope to resume the writing process with it. I almost decided to choose this book for National Novel Writing Month during Fall 2024, but I decided against it at the last minute because I was worried it was too dark of a story for my teacher to see. Maybe next year, if I ever take Creative Writing again."
				data-recs="You want something dark and emmotional with compelling moods to each scene."
